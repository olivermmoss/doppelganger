DOPPELGANGER is a large (by the standards of a solo project in high school project) metroidvania game about being the evil clone.

It was developed on and off over the course of over 3 years and features 6 different areas, 3 powerups, 3 bosses, many enemies, and lots of unique story moments (though nobody, including me, knows where it's all leading)

I think my favorite thing about this game is its artwork -- every area looks beautiful and unique, and there are many complex animations

However, gameplay wise, there's not too much going on, it's just mid-tier platforming like some kind of roblox obby.  There's not really any unique mechanics in the game.

I stopped development because of the above line, and because I'm now devoting so much of my time to the college experience.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a good day :)
